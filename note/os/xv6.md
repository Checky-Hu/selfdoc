xv6 note
======

## chapter0

### interfaces of os
- xv6 implements traditional kernel: a special process that provides service for any other processes;
- process contains: instructions, data and stack. Process in user space uses **system call** to enter kernel space and invokes kernel service.

### process and memory
- xv6 process contains two parts: memory in user space(instructions, data and stack) and process status in kernel spaceï¼›
- xv6 saves the cpu registers for process that isn't running and recover those values when it goes back to running state;
- xv6 uses ELF(Executable and Linking Format);
- `sh.c` implements shell.

### I/O and file descriptor
- file descriptor is an integer that represent an object managed by kernel in process, or simply called `file`;
- each process has its own file descriptor table. `0` means `stdin`, `1` means `stdout`, `2` means `stderr`;
- file descriptor generated by `fork()` and `dup()` share the same offset in one file.

### pipe
- pipe is a pair of file descriptors that represent a small buffer in kernel;
- pipe is different from temp file: self-clean by read and write, no limit for data size and synchronized.

### file system
- file system includes files and directories;
- `mknod()` create a device. A major and minor number together confirm an unique kernel device;
- `stat.h` defines file struct;
- plan 9 implements "everything is file".

## appendix-a

### hardware of personal computer
- personal computer contains: CPU, Memory, I/O devices;
- cpu bus contains: Address Bus, Data Bus, Control Bus.

### cpu and memory

#### common registers
- x86 instruction set contains 8 32-bits common registers: %eax, %ebx, %ecx, %edx, %edi, %esi, %ebp, %esp; and 1 instruction pointer register: %eip;
- `e` means `extended`. So there is 8 16-bits common registers too: %ax, %bx, %cx, %dx, %di, %si, %bp, %sp;
- for `%|a-d|x`, there are 2 8-bits common registers for each, such as: %al(low bits) and %ah(high bits) for %ax.

#### float registers
- x86 instruction set contains 8 80-bits float registers.

#### control registers
- x86 instruction set contains 4 control registers: %cr0, %cr2, %cr3, %cr4.(%cr1 is reserved)

#### debug registers
- x86 instruction set contains 4 debug registers: %dr0, %dr1, %dr2, %dr3.

#### segment registers
- x86 instruction set contains 6 segment registers: %cs, %ds, %es, %fs, %gs, %ss.

#### global/local descriptor table registers
- x86 instruction set contains: %gdtr, %ldtr.

### I/O
- x86 instruction set contains `in, out` for I/O devices' read and write;
- modern x86 use `memory mapped I/O` for interacting with I/O devices just like memory.
